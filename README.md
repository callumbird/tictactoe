# tictactoe

TicTacToe (or noughts and crosses) game made to be played in the terminal.
Classes are as follows:

TicTacToe calls all methods and holds the 'turn' for loop for the human vs human game.

GameBoard holds all methods involved in board creation, retention and win checking.

UserInput holds all methods involved in input from user and checking if its valid for its purpose.

Computer logic holds all methods involved in being able to play aainst the computer. 'Gregor' is the profile for a computer that performs only random moves whereas menerva will be a 'perfect' tictactoe player when I get around to coding that in.
